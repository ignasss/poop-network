# poop-network
A place to shit about stuff

Because shit is not something you can predefine or make the way you want, than let's create some kind of dynamic place for all thoose poops.

# Nr 1
--- We will want to have some actual placeholders for your poopies to put in. (Field designer/engine/pooper???)

- **Field**:
    - Field will be object holding link to **FieldValue** GUID field;
    - Field will have **name** field;
- **FieldValue**:
    - Field value will have **type** field ENUM;
    - Field value will have **value** field string?;
- **Ability to create fields**
- **Ability to edit fields**
    - Lock some edit features to prevent data corruption.
- **Ability to delete fields**
    - When deleting field from the system, give user a warning that it will delete all field values asosiated with it and also it will be deleted from all screens.

# Nr 2
--- We will want to show some screens where all poops you want to put, can fit. (Screen designer/engine/pooper???)

# Nr 3
--- We will need to somehow store all those poops somewhere so we will need a database which would be fast at digging poop and could hold up shitloads (Mongo????)

# Nr 4
--- We need something smart for displaying and handling all that shitty mess, some kind of FE framework, which is popular, because my FE skills are shit. (Angular?)
