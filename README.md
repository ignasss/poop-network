# poop-network
A place to shit about stuff

Because shit is not something you can predefine or make the way you want, than let's create some kind of dynamic place for all thoose poops.

# 1 We will want to show some screens where all poops you want to put, can fit. (Screen designer/engine/pooper???)

# 2 We will want to have some actual placeholders for your poopies to put in. (Field designer/engine/pooper???)

# 3 We will need to somehow store all those poops somewhere so we will need a database which would be fast at digging poop and could hold up shitloads (Mongo????)

# 4 We need something smart for displaying and handling all that shitty mess, some kind of FE framework, which is popular, because my FE skills are shit. (Angular?)
